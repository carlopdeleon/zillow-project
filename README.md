# Zillow Project

# Project Description

### The Zillow Data Science Team is reaching out to data scientists around the nation in order to find the best and most optimized machine learning model that can predict a home's value. The homes that will be used for this process will be Single Family properties that were sold in 2017. These homes are located in three California counties: Los Angeles County, Orange County, Ventura County


# Business Goals

* Uncover drivers that influence a home's value
* Use machine learning algorythms with drivers to accurately predict a future home's value
* Develop an understanding on how the drivers influence a home's value

# Initial Thoughts

### My initial hypothesis is that a home's value is heavily influenced by its living area (square feet),  number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.
